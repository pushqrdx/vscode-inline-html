## Example

![](https://github.com/pushqrdx/vscode-inline-html/raw/master/docs/demo.gif)

## Usage

Use (`/*html*/`, `html`, `/*css*/`, `css`) followed by the backtick \` character inside a `Javascript` or `Typescript` file to get full editor support inside the template literal. Using this extension, you can drastically enhance `Polymer` development experience or just add `html` or `css` support inside an `ES6` template string. Formatting is also supported.
